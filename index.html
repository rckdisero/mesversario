      <p>
        40 days and 40 nights<br>
        I waited for a girl like you to come and save my life<br>
        All the days I waited for you<br>
        You know the ones who said I'd never find someone like you<br>
        'Cause you were out of my league<br>
        All the things I believed<br>
        You were just the right kind<br>
        Yeah, you were more than just a dream<br>
        You were out of my league<br>
        Got my heartbeat racing<br>
        If I die, don't wake me<br>
        'Cause you are more than just a dream<br>
        From time to time I pinch myself<br>
        Because I think my girl mistakes me for somebody else<br>
        And every time she takes my hand<br>
        All the wonders that remain<br>
        Become a simple fact
